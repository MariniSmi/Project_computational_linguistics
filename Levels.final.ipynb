There are various types of chocolate consultants, so you can follow the best career path for you. You could work full-time with well-known brands or focus on smaller brands that specialise in specific types of chocolate.\\n\\nTo be successful in this job, you must have a passion for chocolate and an interest in understanding the many varieties of cocoa. For this reason, you need a lot of knowledge in certain subjects. Chemistry and food-based subjects are particularly useful. Although you could work for companies that produce chocolate-based products, you could also be in charge of your career, advising chocolate buyers on which products to buy or running chocolate-tasting events.\\n\\nB. LEGO sculptor\\n\\nMany of us have enjoyed building things with LEGO blocks as children, but for some people, this childhood activity can turn into a career. LEGO has temporary jobs and long-term positions for certified professionals who create models and sets for the company. These LEGO sculptors work within specific themes and are based in Legoland Discovery Centres around the world.\\n\\nBecoming a LEGO sculptor is quite challenging. There are usually only between nine and 30 jobs available worldwide. To be hired, you need to successfully complete different tasks, including building difficult LEGO models.\\n\\nC. Island caretaker\\n\\nThis role is often described as the best job in the world, and it’s easy to see why! In 2009, the Queensland Tourism Board created a position to promote the Islands of the Great Barrier Reef. The lucky employee from the UK – chosen among thousands of applicants – earned £73,400 on a temporary job for six months, living on an island in the Great Barrier Reef. His job involved swimming, exploring underwater, and having fun while filming and blogging about his experiences. At the end of his contract, the British island caretaker was promoted to a new job as a Global Tourism Ambassador, representing Queensland tourism around the world.\\n\\nD. Shark tank cleaner\\n\\nCleaning windows might not sound thrilling, but what if you did it in the water surrounded by sharks? That would be a different story, surely! Shark tank cleaners have to swim with sharks to make the tank’s glass clean and shiny while visitors watch the whole process. This job requires a person who is not only brave but also a strong swimmer and experienced diver. Of course, if you’re afraid of sharks, it might be safer to look for other opportunities!\\n\\nE. Professional sleeper\\n\\nIf you love sleeping and can’t get enough of it, why not turn that passion into a career? Professional sleepers often participate in sleep studies, but there are also more unusual opportunities. For example, in 2009, women were hired for a temporary job where they were paid to sleep as part of a ‘living art’ exhibit at The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York while tourists visited the museum.\\n\\n', 'Halloween\\nHalloween (also referred to as All Hollows\\' Eve) is a holiday that\\'s celebrated in America on 31 October of each year, regardless of what day of the week this date falls on. Although it is rooted in religion, Halloween today is enjoyed mainly because of its decorations, costumes, candy, treats, and general excitement, and furthermore, it is enjoyed by most everyone.\\n\\nBefore Halloween, many individuals carve a design into an orange-colored pumpkin, or a solid, durable vegetable. Once a personally satisfying design is carved, a lit candle is typically put inside a pumpkin, thereby making it a Jack-O-Lantern. At night, this design lights up against the darkness.\\n\\nBesides carving pumpkins, some celebrate Halloween by putting decorations up. Supernatural (referring in this case to non-natural creatures that\\'re typically based in fiction) figures, including vampires, ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and more, generally account for most of these decorations. Bugs, spiders, cobwebs, gravestones, and anything else that can be considered creepy (or unusual and possibly scary) can also be found on Halloween, in decoration form.\\n\\nOnly some adults celebrate Halloween, and they generally do so by attending parties. Inversely, the vast majority of children dress in costume (Halloween costumes can be based upon anything, from the mentioned supernatural creatures to the stars of today\\'s films) and walk from door to door in search of candy—a practice known as trick or treat—on Halloween. After knocking on a door (houses that participate in Halloween usually leave a light on), one says, \"Trick or Treat\" and a piece (or pieces!) of candy is given to him or her.', 'Hotel Reservation\\nReceptionist: Good afternoon! This is Capitol Hotels in Washington, D.C. How may I help you?\\n\\nMr. Abrams: Hi, I’d like to schedule a reservation for this upcoming weekend from Friday night until Sunday.\\n\\nReceptionist: Sure! Let me check and see what rooms are available. Do you need a room with one bed or two?\\n\\nMr. Abrams: My wife and I will be visiting the city, but a room with one bed will be just fine.\\n\\nReceptionist: Alright... It looks like we have several rooms available. Would you care for a room with a balcony?\\n\\nMr. Abrams: A single room with no balcony will suit our needs just fine. I did notice on your website that you have a pool and an exercise room. Are these facilities available for all hotel guests?\\n\\nReceptionist: Yes, all hotel guests are allowed access to those facilities. The hotel stay also includes breakfast. We have a restaurant on-site that also serves lunch and dinner, but those meals are not included in your lodging fee.\\n\\nMr. Abrams: Okay, that’s fine. What time are both check-in and check-out?\\n\\nReceptionist: Check-in for you on Friday can be any time after 3:00 p.m. Check-out will be on Sunday before noon.\\n\\nMr. Abrams: Sounds great!\\n\\nReceptionist: I am glad that I could help you today. Is there anything else that you need at this point in time?\\n\\nMr. Abrams: Would you like my credit card information now, or can I take care of that upon my arrival to the hotel’s reception desk?\\n\\nReceptionist: We can handle payment upon your arrival on Friday. We look forward to seeing you then!\\n\\nMr. Abrams: Thank you! I look forward to my stay.\\n\\nReceptionist: Enjoy the rest of your week!', 'Jobs and Professions\\nAs has been the case for many years, jobs, or forms of employment wherein employees perform a service or duty in exchange for financial compensation, play a prominent role in society. Furthermore, all jobs—even those of seemingly little significance—are important, as they simply wouldn\\'t exist if their specific responsibilities weren\\'t of value to employers (companies or persons that pay others for their work), customers (individuals who pay money for a product or service), and the economy generally.\\n\\nTeachers, or educational professionals tasked with helping students understand certain subjects and topics, are especially crucial today. In short, teachers help their students to become qualified for their future careers.\\n\\nDoctors, or medical professionals who specialize in providing health-related assistance to patients, are some of the most respected individuals in America and the world. It\\'s the responsibility of doctors to help those who feel less-than-stellar to determine the underlying health issue(s) and recommend an effective treatment (or remedy to a disease, disorder, or condition).\\n\\nThere are quite a few types of specialty doctors in America (besides MD, which simply means \"medical doctor\"), all of whom can be referred to simply as \"Doctor (Name).\" Dentists (mouth/teeth doctors), dermatologists (skin doctors), and psychiatrists (mental-health doctors) are just a few examples of the many different types of doctors.\\n\\nAdditionally, nurses are medical professionals who help to administer doctor-ordered treatments to patients.\\n\\nPolice officers are law enforcement professionals whose job it is to protect citizens, solve crimes, and assure that rules and regulations are followed. Similarly, firefighters serve the public by responding to fires (and other emergency situations) and using high-tech equipment to extinguish these fires, while bringing any individuals who\\'re in danger to safety.\\n\\nFarmers maintain fields of crops (or vegetable/fruit plants) and/or collections of animals with the intention of selling these products as food.\\n\\nChefs/cooks prepare meals in professional settings, including restaurants, cafeterias, and other venues wherein food and drink are sold, for customers. Chefs are generally experienced in cooking and managing kitchens.\\n\\nWaiters bring menus, beverages, meals, and ultimately, the check (or a bill of the foods and drinks purchased in a transaction) to tables in restaurants and other establishments that serve food.\\n\\nArtists produce art, or works of creative significance, including music, paintings, drawings, poetry, writing, and more.', 'London\\nLondon is a famous and historic city. It is the capital of England in the United Kingdom. The city is quite popular for international tourism because London is home to one of the oldest-standing monarchies in the western hemisphere. Rita and Joanne recently traveled to London. They were very excited for their trip because this was their first journey overseas from the United States.\\n\\nAmong the popular sights that Rita and Joanne visited are Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. Big Ben is one of London’s most famous monuments. It is a large clock tower located at the northern end of Westminster Palace. The clock tower is 96 meters tall. Unfortunately, Rita and Joanne were only able to view the tower from the outside. The women learned that the tower’s interior is undergoing renovations until 2021.\\n\\nFortunately, the London Eye, the city’s famous Ferris wheel, was open to the public. The London Eye is situated along the southern shores of the Thames River. This attraction stands 135 meters high. It is one of London’s most well-known spots for gaining aerial views of the city. Each capsule of the Ferris wheel can hold up to 25 passengers. When their capsule stopped at the top of the Ferris wheel, the women took spectacular panoramic photographs of the beautiful cityscape below.\\n\\nThe last place that Rita and Joanne visited was Buckingham Palace, the home of the Queen of England. The women were impressed by the palace’s incredible architecture and historical value. Both Rita and Joanne enjoyed watching the Queen’s guards outside the palace. These guards wore red tunic uniforms, shiny black boots, and bearskin hats. Despite the women’s attempts to catch the attention of the guards, the guards are specifically trained to avoid distractions. Because of this, the guards ignored the women completely.\\n\\nJoanne and Rita had an amazing time visiting the city of London, and they are inspired to seek more international travel destinations in the future.', 'Los Angeles\\nStephanie recently took a weekend trip to Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is a coastal city situated along the Pacific Ocean. Many celebrities earned their claim to fame here. Although the town offers many attractions centered around Hollywood culture, there is a lot to see and visit in Los Angeles.\\n\\nOf course, all things related to Hollywood are popular tourist attractions. The Hollywood Sign, located the Hollywood Hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, is a famous landmark for this star-studded town. Once in downtown Hollywood, it’s possible to take a stroll along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This landmark contains more than 2500 brass stars dedicated to celebrities who have made a significant impact on the entertainment industry. In Hollywood, visitors can even take tours of popular movie studios. Stephanie had a chance to visit Universal Studios, which produces her favorite films.\\n\\nLos Angeles is also a popular beach town, offering plenty of opportunities for sunbathing and surfing. A common beach destination is the Santa Monica Pier, which offers rides and attractions to its visitors. Here, Stephanie rode the iconic Ferris wheel, which offered her a spectacular view of the city and coast.\\n\\nThese are just some of the things Stephanie experienced during her visit to Los Angeles. She loved her trip, and she hopes to return someday soon.', 'Miami\\nChristina visited Miami during her winter vacation. She is from Boston, where it is cold during the winter months. Miami, however, has a very warm climate. There are many sunny days in Miami, and people can go to the beach all year long. Christina spent a good portion of her trip on the beach to relax and sunbathe. However, she also explored Miami and its surroundings.\\n\\nInspired by Miami’s proximity to the ocean, Christina visited the Miami Seaquarium to learn about marine life. There, she watched a show using trained dolphins, killer whales, and other aquatic mammals. She took a lot of pictures of the sea creatures jumping out of the water and performing tricks.\\n\\nChristina also took an excursion to the Everglades National Park. This park is a protected area spanning 1.5 million acres. Because the park is mostly swampland, it is home to many reptiles. Native animals include snakes, alligators, and crocodiles. The park is also great for birdwatching. Christina enjoyed hiking the trails in the Everglades and observing the wildlife in its natural environment.\\n\\nWhen Christina returned to the city, she visited Little Havana. This is Miami’s Cuban neighborhood. Christina could see that Little Havana’s people demonstrated a lot of pride for their Cuban heritage. There were many outdoor shops and vendors, live musicians, and the Cuban cuisine was delicious. Little Havana was Christina’s favorite part about her trip to Miami. This neighborhood made Christina feel like she had traveled to Cuba without ever having to leave the United States.', 'San Francisco\\nIn June, Diane visited her friends who live in San Francisco, California. This was Diane’s first time in the city, and she enjoyed her opportunities to walk around and explore.\\n\\nOn the first day of her trip, Diane visited the Golden Gate Bridge. This red suspension bridge measures 1.7 miles in length. Diane and her friends did not walk across the bridge. However, they viewed it from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which offers hiking trails, picnicking areas, and presents spectacular views of the bridge and city. Diane and her friends made sure to take a group photograph here, featuring the bridge in the background.\\n\\nThe next day, Diane and her friends visited Alcatraz Island. This island is located 1.25 miles offshore in the San Francisco Bay. It used to serve as a lighthouse, military fort, and prison. Diane and her friends took a small tour boat across bay to reach the island. Their visit included a guided tour through the old military base and prison. They also took a walk around the island to appreciate some of the native wildlife in addition to the views of the city.\\n\\nDiane and her friends spent the final day of her vist in San Francisco’s downtown area. Diane’s favorite part of her entire trip was taking a trolley to transport her up and down the hilly streets of San Francisco. Diane did a lot of shopping downtown on her last day. She and her friends celebrated the end of her visit by having dinner at one of San Francisco’s best restaurants.', 'Thanksgiving\\nThanksgiving is a holiday celebrated predominantly in North America, and it possesses a different meaning in each of the countries where it\\'s acknowledged.\\n\\nIn the United States, Thanksgiving is a federal holiday (meaning all government employees and most private employees are given a day off of work), and always takes places on the Fourth Thursday in November, regardless of the date.\\n\\nThe holiday signifies the immense progress made by pilgrims, or some of the first travelers to North America, at Plymouth Plantation circa 1621. It was at this time that the hungry and weary Pilgrims were taught (by Native Americans) how to grow and produce food on North America\\'s unique terrain. Once they\\'d grown (and caught) an abundance of food, the Pilgrims were expectedly thankful, and they celebrated alongside the Native Americans who provided them with such valuable assistance. President Abraham Lincoln initiated the contemporary practice of Thanksgiving by calling for a \"day of Thanksgiving\" during one of his Civil War addresses.\\n\\nIn America today, Thanksgiving remains firmly engrained in its historical roots, and is widely considered to be a day for giving thanks for good food, good times, and family. Thanksgiving dinner generally consists of turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, vegetables, gravy, and ample desserts. To be sure, indulging in abundance is a cornerstone of the holiday, as doing so could only be possible if one possesses abundance.', 'The Empire State Building\\nWhen exploring New York City, there are several different options for activities during a day trip. Some visitors come to see a show, visit art museums, or simply to shop in many of the city’s high-end retailers. However, many tourists simply come to New York City for the sightseeing. One of the most visited landmarks in New York City is the Empire State Building.\\n\\nThe Empire State Building, constructed in 1931, is a 102-story skyscraper, the ninth highest building in the world, and the fourth tallest structure in the United States. It is located in Midtown, Manhattan. This skyscraper is an iconic symbol of the city, having been featured in over 90 popular movies (as of 2018) throughout film history. Tourists come from all over the world to visit this building and view the city from its famous observation decks.\\n\\nMatthew, an enthusiast of historic buildings, was excited for this trip to New York City because he has always appreciated architectural design. Matthew purchased a ticket that granted him access to beautiful 360-degree views of the city. The ticket included an elevator ride that stopped at two different vantage points, one at the 86th floor and the other at the rooftop observatory on the 102nd floor. From these observation decks, Matthew took incredible photographs of the entire New York City skyline. The rooftop views granted Matthew perfect aerial perspectives of Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, and many other important city landmarks.', 'The four seasons\\nThe four seasons are spring, summer, fall, and winter, and although various areas of the United States experience drastically different weather during these times, all portions of the country recognize the seasons; winter in California may bring heat, and winter in New York may bring blizzards, but both periods are nevertheless winter.\\n\\nFollowing winter, spring begins on 20 March and ends on either 20 June or 21 June, in the United States (this date may vary slightly from year to year and hemisphere to hemisphere). For most, spring is a time of \"thawing,\" when the cold and snow of the winter are replaced by sunshine, reasonable temperatures, green grass, and more. It is also the season wherein previously dormant bees and butterflies reemerge, and when birds become more active.\\n\\nSummer follows spring and spans from about 21 June to 22 September, in America. Summer is the warmest, the longest, and (arguably) the liveliest of the four seasons; students from kindergarten to college are given two or so summer months off from class, and to be sure, there are more young individuals out and about during this season than any other. It\\'s not uncommon to see shorts, t-shirts, and sunglasses worn by those who\\'re soaking up the summer\\'s hot sun, and to stay cool, many individuals crank the air conditioning, take a dip in a swimming pool, and/or explore the ever-comforting ocean waves.\\n\\nAutumn (or fall), more than being a simple precursor to winter, is one of the most beautiful and exciting seasons. Spanning from 22 September to 21 December (technically, that is; snow will begin to fall long before this latter date, in most parts of the country, leading many to classify the period as winter) in the US, autumn is characterized by falling leaves, Halloween (on 31 October), and Thanksgiving. During fall, traditional farmers harvest their produce, and the aforementioned falling leaves change to gorgeous orange, red, and yellow colors; these colors are generally associated with autumn itself, in turn.\\n\\nIn the US, winter spans from 21 December to 20 March, and is, as one would expect, the coldest of the four seasons. In the eastern, northern, and central portions of the country, winter snowfall can be considerable; in the western and southern portions of the country, winter snowfall is highly unlikely, but temperatures nevertheless drop from their usual. Winter is most widely known for its snow and the Christmas holiday, but it also boasts New Year\\'s Eve (on December 31, in recognition of the start of a new year) and other special days. Ice skating, sledding, ice hockey, and snowball fights are commonly enjoyed winter activities.', 'Actors who died on set\\nBrandon Lee\\nBrandon Lee, son of the famous martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, died in 1993, while filming “The Crow”. He was acting as the main character in a scene where his character gets shot, but no one knew that a small piece of a real bullet got stuck in the gun. When the gun was fired, the piece of the bullet came out and hit Brandon in the stomach. Even though doctors tried to help him, Lee passed away later that day. This accident made people think more about how to keep actors safe on movie sets.\\n\\nVic Morrow\\nVic Morrow’s death happened during the filming of “Twilight Zone: The Movie” in 1982. He portrayed a character in the Vietnam War. In this scene, Morrow was carrying two child actors across a river while being chased by a helicopter. During filming, explosives were used, causing the helicopter to crash in the river. As a result, Morrow and the two young actors lost their lives immediately and six passengers onboard were injured. During the investigation, the film director was found guilty of having children working near explosives illegally.\\n\\nJon-Erik Hexum\\nThe accidental death of Jon-Erik Hexum occurred on the TV show “Cover Up” in 1984. During a break from filming, the actor was playing with a gun used in one of the scenes pointing it at his head and pulled the trigger as a joke. Even though the gun did not have real bullets, the force was strong enough to hurt him badly. A piece of bone from his head went into his brain. He was taken to the hospital immediately, but despite emergency surgery, he was pronounced brain dead six days later.\\n\\nRoy Kinnear\\nRoy Kinnear’s tragic accident took place while he was filming “The Return of the Musketeers” in 1989. During a scene with horse riding, Kinnear fell from his horse and broke a bone near one of his hips. Despite the severity of his injury, Kinnear was determined to continue filming and completed his scenes. However, his health conditions got worse and ended up affecting his heart. Sadly, Kinnear passed away from a heart attack caused by these complications.\\n\\nSteve Irwin\\nSteve Irwin, known as “The Crocodile Hunter,” was working on a documentary called “Ocean’s Deadliest” in 2006 off the coast of Queensland, Australia when tragedy struck. While filming a segment about dangerous fish, Irwin approached a stingray – a type of flat fish with long, sharp tails – in shallow water. The stingray felt it was in danger and attacked the man. The fish had used its sharp tail to poke Steve Irwin in the chest, and the pointy part went into his heart. His crew and emergency services tried to save him, but Irwin didn’t survive. His sudden death shocked the world and left millions of fans upset for the loss of a man who was truly passionate about the natural world.', 'The Golden Gate Bridge\\nSome of the most important landmarks in the United States include feats of architecture and modern engineering. San Francisco, California, is a beautiful city on its own, but it is also home to The Golden Gate Bridge, a 1.7 mile suspension bridge connecting the San Francisco Peninsula to the Marin Headlands. The bridge holds the title of one of the Wonders of the Modern World according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.\\n\\nOne of the most popular ways to appreciate the bridge is to take an excursion to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area just outside of San Francisco. The park contains hiking trails, great spots for picnicking, and offers some of the best vantage points for panoramic photographs of the bridge leading into the city.\\n\\nDavid recently had some friends visit him in San Francisco, and he made sure to include a visit to the recreation area as part of their tour. They enjoyed walking through the trails, observing some of the native wildlife, and even having a casual picnic in the park. David’s friends were thankful that he guided them through this impressive area of California. They made sure to take a group photograph with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. David’s friends had the picture framed, and they later presented it to David in order to thank him for his hospitality during their stay.', 'The Grand Canyon\\nThe Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, is located in the state of Arizona. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Formed by over 70 million years of erosion from the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon offers a spectacular view. The canyon spans 277 miles in length, up to 18 miles in width, and it measures over a mile in depth at its deepest points. Carlos always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon, and recently he received the chance to hike some of the trails and take several panoramic photographs during his visit.\\n\\nWhen Carlos arrived at the visitor center, he watched a brief movie that taught tourists about the Grand Canyon National Park and the geological history of the canyon’s formation. Later, Carlos followed a hiking trail to become even further acquainted with the canyon. While walking through the trails, Carlos saw some tourists riding donkeys to traverse the canyon’s ridges. Throughout his hiking expedition, Carlos used a map to find some of the best hot spots for photographs within the canyon. He revisited some areas at different points in the day because sun angles and lighting can make a big difference in the quality of a photo.\\n\\nCarlos was very pleased that he got to travel to the Grand Canyon. He loves hiking and photography, so this was the perfect outdoor experience for him. He posted all of his best pictures on social media, and his friends were amazed by his breathtaking, panoramic shots.\\n\\n', 'The Statue of Liberty\\nThe Statue of Liberty, arguably one of New York City’s most iconic symbols, is a popular tourist attraction for first-time visitors to the city. This 150-foot monument was gifted to the United States from France in order to celebrate 100 years of America’s independence. The statue is located on Liberty Island, and it is accessible by taking a ferry from either Battery Park in New York City or Liberty State Park in Jersey City.\\n\\nWhen Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue’s crown.\\n\\nDuring her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue’s exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!\\n\\nAfter touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can’t wait to return to the city in the future.', 'Valentine\\'s Day\\nValentine\\'s Day (or Saint Valentine\\'s Day) is a holiday that, in the United States, takes place on February 14, and technically signifies the accomplishments of St. Valentine, a third-century Roman saint.\\n\\nWith that said, most Americans, instead of honoring St. Valentine through religious ceremony, enjoy the holiday by engaging in \"romantic\" behavior with their significant other or someone who they wish to be their significant other; gifts, special dinners, and other acknowledgements of affection comprise most individuals\\' Valentine\\'s Day celebrations.\\n\\nChocolates and flowers are commonly given as gifts during Valentine\\'s Day, as are accompanying greeting cards (greeting card companies release new Valentine\\'s Day designs annually). Red and pink are generally understood to be \"the colors\" of Valentine\\'s Day, and many individuals, instead of celebrating romantically, spend the holiday with their friends and/or family members.\\n\\nVariations of Valentine\\'s Day are celebrated across the globe throughout the year. In America, the holiday, although acknowledged by the vast majority of the population, isn\\'t federally recognized; no time off work is granted for Valentine\\'s Day.', 'Washington, D.C.\\nYesterday, Stephen returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. His visit took place during the week prior to the Fourth of July. Logically, there were many activities and celebrations in town in preparation for Independence Day. During his stay in the city, Stephen visited a lot of important historical sites and monuments, and he left with a deeper understanding of the political history of the United States.\\n\\nStephen spent a lot of time outdoors exploring the important monuments surrounding Capitol Hill. Of course, he saw the White House from its outside gate at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Stephen also visited the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, and the Lincoln Memorial. These statues and pavilions are dedicated to former U.S. presidents. They commemorate the contributions that these leaders made throughout American history. Washington, D.C. also has several war memorials dedicated to fallen soldiers during the major wars of the 20th century.\\n\\nAway from the Capitol Hill area, Washington, D.C. has many museums and art galleries worth visiting. Stephen enjoyed his visit to Washington, D.C. because he learned a lot more about American history after touring each important landmark.', 'Yellowstone National Park\\nYellowstone National Park, located in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, was established as the first national park in the United States. The park is a popular destination for visitors who enjoy ecological tourism as it offers forests, mountains, and abundant ecosystems to explore. Some of Yellowstone’s most well-known landmarks are its geothermal hot springs and geysers, the most famous of which is named Old Faithful.\\n\\nLast fall, Lisa and her friends decided to take a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park. They arranged to stay at one of the park’s many convenient campsites. For their camping trip, they brought their backpacks, sleeping bags, and a cooler of food and drinks. They pitched their tents immediately upon arriving to their campsite.\\n\\nDuring their trip, Lisa and her friends hiked the many trails of the park, exploring its natural surroundings. In the forest, they saw a lot of local wildlife. Lisa was surprised to see a family of grizzly bears, some gray wolves, and even bald eagles flying overhead. Outside of the woods, they admired the beauty of some of Yellowstone’s natural cascades.\\n\\nSince Yellowstone contains many hot springs and the world’s largest area of active geysers, Lisa and her friends visited many different geyser sites. They even spent an afternoon swimming in Yellowstone’s Boiling River. Of all of the sites, Lisa and her friends agreed that Old Faithful was the most impressive. Lisa and her friends waited patiently for the geyser to erupt. After about 40 minutes, a stream of boiling water over 100 feet tall sprayed from the ground and up into the air. Fortunately, no one got wet!\\n\\n', 'A - Form and Colour\\nThis is year-long course is perfect for people who want to learn about how to use a camera and who want to take it up as a profession.

The class is suitable for everyone, as there is very little walking involved.', 'Different Colours can affect us in many different ways; that’s according to Verity Allen.  In her new series ‘Colour me Healthy’, Verity looks at the ways that colours can influence how hard we work and the choices we make.  They can even change our emotions and even influence how healthy we are. \\n\\n‘Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things?’ says Verity.  ‘Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red.  It’s never green.  Why not?  For some reason we think that blue and white is clean, while we think of green products as being a bit disgusting.  It’s the same for businesses.  We respect a company which writes its name in blue or black, but we don’t respect one that uses pink or orange.  People who design new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy.’\\n\\nDuring this four-part series, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each programme.  She meets people who work in all aspects of the colour industry, from people who design food packets, to people who name the colours of lipsticks.  Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to support their ideas, such as the American ‘Colour Doctor’ who believes that serious diseases can be cured by the use of coloured lights.  However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results. \\n\\nOverall, it’s an interesting show, and anyone who watches it will probably find out something new.  But because Verity is goes out of her way to be polite to everyone she meets on the series, it’s up to the viewers to make their own decisions about how much they should believe.', 'A Peace Haven\\nLocated right on the sea front, our hostel is popular with surfers. Plenty of parking and storage for equipment. Drying room and laundry. Prepare your own meals in our large kitchen, or eat out at one of the many seafood restaurants nearby.

Perfect for families who want a bit of peace and quiet.\\nH The Art House\\nThe Art House is a bit different!  All eight double rooms are furnished in the different artistic styles. The Art Deco room, for example, is decorated with theatrical glass furniture, mirrors and fur, while the 1960s room is fun and colourful, and has pop art on the walls. The Art House offers bed and breakfast accommodation on the edge of town, walking distance from the beach.', 'Horton\\nAt first glance, there is little in Horton to attract people. The other nearby towns have much more to offer: Bradfield has its river and historic buildings, while Newtown has shops and entertainment. The buildings of Horton look dirty and unloved. For shops, there is a small supermarket, a few bargain shops, a bakery which, strangely, does not sell bread and a florist which has one stand of sad-looking flowers. Even so, Horton has several advantages over its neighbouring towns.\\n\\nFirstly, it has a country park. Four thousand years ago, this was an important fort. There are no historic remains here now, but there are wonderful views over the countryside. On sunny weekends you can often see kids out with their parents, kicking balls or flying kites.\\n\\nThere aren’t many job opportunities in Horton, and the roads to nearby cities aren’t really fast, but there are excellent rail links. You can be in London in an hour and a half, and other cities are less than an hour away. That means that parents can earn a good salary and still get home in time to spend the evenings with their families. Houses in Horton aren’t pretty, but they’re functional and cheap. The streets are quiet and safe, and there are plenty of parks and playgrounds. It has a library, three primary schools and a secondary school, St. Mark’s.  It’s not as academically brilliant as other schools in the area, but it is friendly and offers a wide range of subjects and activities to children of all abilities and backgrounds.  The town also has a swimming and a sports centre, and the community halls hold regular clubs and events for people of all ages.', 'Memorabilia: What’s the thrill?\\nMy friends wonder why I have an extensive collection of other people’s clothes and shoes, old concert programmes and albums at home. They think I want to relive special moments in my childhood. That might be true for some collectors, but I’m not sentimental. You can make a lot of money from things that have a special place in history. Sports equipment like balls and shoes that were used in a great match, props from popular movies, clothes worn by famous people and first editions of books are all valuable, especially if they are signed.\\n\\nThere are a few different ways you can find this sort of memorabilia. First, you can buy it at an auction. It’s expensive, but if you are lucky, it will be worth it because memorabilia can suddenly increase in value, and you could make a lot of money. For example, a baseball signed by Babe Ruth sold for over $77,000. In 2017, just four years later, a similar one sold for $180,000, over twice as much! Imagine if you had enough money to buy that!\\n\\nI can’t possibly buy that kind of memorabilia, but it is possible to buy part of it. Some companies look for rare items from around the world that they think will increase in value. People can buy a share of the memorabilia and buy and sell their shares over time. That’s a great way to make money without spending a fortune, and for a little while, you can be the part-owner of a piece of history, although you can’t take it home!\\n\\nIf your goal is actually to own memorabilia, you can find some interesting items in second-hand shops. Sometimes, an old collector dies, and their spouse gives away their possessions without realising their value. You could also try to predict who will become famous in the future. Getting some shoes or a ball signed by someone who isn’t famous yet is not too hard. Then you just have to wait until they do something spectacular. Then you have something really valuable! That’s how I got a signed tennis racket from one of the world’s top players!\\n\\nI have been tricked before, though. I bought a signed record online a few years ago. A few years later, I tried to sell it at an auction house. When I gave it to the auctioneer, he rubbed the signature with his finger. It was smooth, not bumpy, so he knew it wasn’t done with a pen. Someone probably printed it on. That was a pity. I’m also always careful to keep my memorabilia in perfect condition. You can’t just put it in a cupboard and leave it there. I once left some old concert programmes in a cupboard, and the paper curled and changed colour. Now I use special packaging and equipment to make sure the room doesn’t get too hot, cold or damp. It isn’t cheap, but you need it if you are serious about collecting.\\n\\nOf course, I never know which memorabilia will become valuable and which will not. I had some signed shoes from a great young basketball player, but then he had a bad injury and quit, so those shoes will probably never be worth much. Plus, the value of memorabilia goes up and down. A t-shirt signed by a popular celebrity could be worth a lot now, but its value might have halved in five years’ time when that celeb is no longer famous.', 'The Motor Show will be returning to Eastbrook this July, and if you thought last year’s show was good, you’re going to love the show this year.  It’s going to be bigger, there’ll be more things to do, and there will also be several famous faces around the place.\\n\\nIt’ll be held on the 18th of July, and this year the Motor Show will not take place on the Park School Field like last year, but will take place on the Three Tree Show Ground.  This will give a lot more space for car parking, which was a problem last year.\\n\\nThere will be lots of great things to see and do.  There’ll be a display of old cars and buses from as early as the 1920s, all in beautiful condition.  There will also be a display of Cars of the Future – cars powered by electricity or the sun, so you’ll have the chance to see what we could all be driving in fifty years’ time.\\n\\nYou will also have the chance to see some great people from the motor industry.  Jack Tyler, famous presenter of the television show ‘Fast Driver’ will be signing copies of his new book, ‘Speed King.’  Top Racing Driver Michael Boreman will also be attending and giving out signed photographs.\\nIf you’re thinking that the Eastbrook Motor Show is just for men, and has nothing for the ladies, think again.  There will be lots of stalls selling gifts, jewellery and clothes, and there is also the chance to win a beautiful sports car especially designed for female drivers.  All you have to do is guess the number of bears in the car – I imagine that means toy bears not real bears!  So you can’t miss that, can you?\\n\\nIf you want to go to the Eastbrook Motor Show, tickets are twelve pounds for adults and six pounds for children, but you can get a family ticket for two adults and up to three children for thirty pounds.  If you want to avoid queues on the day, you should buy your tickets in advance.  You can get them from the Eastbrook village shop, or online on www.eastbrookmotorshow.co.uk.  See you there! It’s going to be a great day!', 'Man: We are lucky to have in the studio today, Molly Taylor.  Molly is arranging an activity course for the summer holidays.  Molly, this is the second year of the course, isn’t it?\\n\\nMolly: Yes, that’s right.  The summer course operated for the first time last year for a six week period from the middle of July until the end of August, the length of the summer holidays.  This year we’ll be holding the course again.  We did think about making the course longer this year and have a seven week course, as there are some schools in the area which finish term a week earlier than other schools.  In fact, the two private schools in the town have eight week summer holidays.  But in the end we decided to keep to the same plan as last year.\\n\\nMan: But, as I understand, last year’s summer activity course was not a complete success, was it?\\n\\nMolly: Well, there were a few problems, yes.  We were actually very surprised last year by the number of people interested in the course.  We didn’t actually have enough staff to look after all the children who wanted to attend, and we had to turn people away.  The weather also gave us some difficulties.  There was such a lot of rain that we couldn’t go outside as often as we wanted to, but had prepared for that.  We had art and music activities that the children could do indoors, so they weren’t left with nothing to do.\\n\\nMan: So, what activities can the children look forward to this year?\\n\\nMolly: Well, once again we there will be art and music experts coming in who will lead creative classes for the kids.  We also considered providing some more exciting adventure sports like rock climbing and caving.  We decided not to, in the end, because it would make the course a lot more expensive for parents.  Instead, we’re introducing some fun projects – things that the kids can prepare together and show their parents what they have been doing.  For example, we’re going to put on a talent show and organise an American Night.  I think it will be good fun for the kids, and teach them good skills too.\\n\\nMan: It sounds fun.  So, can children come on the course for the whole summer?\\n\\nMolly: Sure.  Kids can come for the whole length of the course if they like.  We’ve done our best to keep prices low so that it’s not too expensive for children to attend the course for as long as they want.  There’ll be different things to do every week, so the kids won’t be repeating the same activities over and over again.  However, I don’t expect many kids will come for the whole summer, as I’m sure they will all go away with their parents for a week or two.  We do, however, ask that children attend full weeks, not just single days.  It makes it easier for us to keep attendance records.\\n\\nMan: The course is currently available for children aged eight to thirteen.  Why is that?  Why don’t you allow older teenagers to come on your summer course?\\n\\nMolly: It’s true, there really should be something for teenagers to do in the summer holidays too.  Few people organise activities for teenagers because they are seen as difficult to please.  They think they aren’t interested in anything except computers and electronic games.  I don’t think that’s true.  I think they just don’t get the opportunity to do the creative things they used to do when they were children, like painting and team games.   At the same time, I don’t think it’s fair to force teenagers to spend their summer holidays with eight year olds.  They shouldn’t have to feel responsible for the little ones.  They aren’t babysitters.  In the future, when I have found the right staff, I’d like to organise a separate summer course for teens too.\\n\\nMan: So, if a child or a child’s parent is listening, and is interested in coming to your summer activity course, what should they do?\\n\\nMolly: They should go to my website, www.summeractivities.co.uk and print out an application form.  Send it in with a deposit as soon as possible, because the places are going fast.  You’ll need to tell us which weeks you are planning to attend straight away, but you won’t need to choose your activities in advance.  You can choose what you want to do every Monday.  We do need to know if the child has any special needs regarding their diet. \\n\\nMan: Thank you very much for coming to speak to us, Molly.  I hope the summer course is a success!', 'Hello, International welfare office?\\n\\nHello, may I speak to Miranda Rickson please?\\n\\nSpeaking.\\n\\nOh, er hello, Mrs… er Ms Rickson. My name’s Daniel Parker. I saw your advertisement for the welfare officer job on the internet, and I wondered if I could get more information about it.\\n\\nOh, sure, well, what would you like to know?\\n\\nWell, the job is for the summer, isn’t it?\\n\\nYes, that’s right. We need welfare officers for seven weeks, for about 50 hours per week.\\n\\nOfficers? So there is more than one job available?\\n\\nYes, that’s right. We’re actually looking for three welfare officers. We need someone to look after our students at evenings and weekends, not just during the daytime, you see.  Last year we had four welfare officers looking after two hundred students.  We’re expecting about a hundred more students this year, so we want to recruit two more officers.  Three of last year’s officers are returning, so we need three more.\\n\\nSo, the job is looking after students?\\n\\nYes, students from overseas.\\n\\nWhich countries are the students coming from?\\n\\nWell, a few come from the Far East, you know, China, Korea, Japan… and about a quarter are from the Middle East, but the majority are from Eastern Europe.\\n\\nOh, … I don’t speak any other languages except English.\\n\\nDon’t worry about that. They will all speak English, and they’ll understand you, if you talk slowly. The job involves making sure their accommodation is okay, helping them out if they get sick, taking them on trips and so on. \\n\\nThat doesn’t sound so complicated.\\n\\nIt’s not, especially if you know the local area. Do you?\\n\\nYes – well, I moved here a few months ago. I’m a student here.\\n\\nThat’s fine. But the work can be stressful. The hours are long and you won’t get much time away from people.  You need to be ready for anything.\\n\\nAm I expected to work evenings and weekends?\\n\\nYes. You’ll have to work at least three evenings a week on weekdays, and at least one full day at the weekend, sometimes both days.\\n\\nWow.\\n\\nYes, you see, we put on events for the students, sports activities, film nights, quizzes and so on. And at the weekends there are usually two trips; one long distance coach trip, and another one a little closer to home. We need two officers on each trip.\\n\\nSo what hours am I expected to work?\\n\\nWell, the officers take turns to do daytime and evening duties. You will either work from ten in the morning until five pm, or from four pm until ten or eleven at night. On weekends, you’ll work about nine hours a day.\\n\\nWell, that’s okay. I need to earn some money, so I don’t mind working long hours! So, the students are here for seven weeks?\\n\\nActually, no. The first week is for training. There’s a lot to learn before the students arrive, but you’ll only be required for about five hours a day, so the first week is fairly relaxed. But the students arrive at the weekend, so you’ll be needed on the Saturday or the Sunday.\\n\\nWell, thanks for the information. I am definitely interested. I’ll fill in the application form and send it in.\\n\\nNo problem. There’s still a week until the closing date.\\n\\nThanks, Bye!', 'John woke up late this Sunday morning feeling a bit confused. He had spent the night reading, and now his glasses were gone. He put on some clothes and started his search in the bedroom. The room was a bit of a mess with clothes thrown around. He checked under the bed, but his glasses were not there.\\n\\nNext, he went to the hallway, hoping he might have left them there. But after looking on the small table and the shelf, he still did not find them. The hallway was clear, so he moved on. John then headed to the living room where his bookshelf was filled with his favorite reads. He thought he might have left his glasses there last night. But after checking each shelf, all he could find was an old watch.\\n\\nFeeling a bit hungry, John walked to the kitchen. He moved a pile of yesterday’s newspaper and looked behind the fruit bowl, but his glasses were not there either. The counters were clean, and there was no sign of his glasses. With each room he checked, John grew more puzzled about where his glasses could be.\\n\\nJohn had one last place to search – the garage. It was full of boxes, tools, and old furniture. He started searching on the dusty dresser where he usually put things he did not use often. Among some keys and loose change, there was no trace of his glasses. He sighed and left the garage, feeling defeated.\\n\\nHe decided to sit down on the couch and think about where else he could look. As he rested his head in his hands, something slid down the front of his face. To his surprise, and a bit of embarrassment, John realized his glasses had been on his head the whole time. All those hours spent searching through the house, and they were right above his eyes! With a laugh, John stood up, put his glasses on, and went to make a nice cup of coffee, relieved the search was over.', 'Once a year, many countries in Europe come together for a music show. This event is called the Eurovision Song Contest and it’s very popular. People from all around watch their favorite singers perform. The competition started a long time ago, in the year 1956. Since then, it has grown a lot and many countries now take part.\\n\\nEach country sends one song to compete in Eurovision. The songs can be in any language, but often they are in English. The singers can be solo artists or groups, and the styles of music vary. Some songs are fast and make you want to dance. Others are slow and tell a touching story through their lyrics.\\n\\nThe contest has two main parts: the semifinals and the grand finale. In the semifinals, countries compete to get into the finale. Not all countries make it, which adds to the excitement. During the grand finale, the countries that made it through compete to win. People watching the show can vote for their favorite songs. The votes from the viewers are combined with points from a professional jury.\\n\\nThe country with the most points at the end of the night wins. After the winner is announced, there is a big celebration. The winning country’s song is played again and everyone cheers for them. The next year, that country gets the honor of hosting the Eurovision. This means they organize the event and people from all over come to see it. The Eurovision Song Contest is a time of fun, music, and unity for many people. It brings countries together and helps people share their love of music.', 'Staycation: Vacation at Home\\nSometimes, we spend our holidays at home, often called a staycation. It can be relaxing and saves money compared to traveling far. You still can do plenty of fun activities without the need to pack your bags. Here are some ideas for a great staycation.\\n\\nFirstly, you can explore your own city as if you were a tourist. Visit local museums, parks, or new places you haven’t been to. You might discover hidden gems right where you live. Don’t forget to try different foods at local restaurants or cafes.\\n\\nSecondly, you could have a day of pampering at home. Take a long bath, do your nails, or maybe even try a new hairstyle. Put on your favourite music and relax. You can invite friends over and make it more special with everyone’s company.\\n\\nAnother activity is to have a movie marathon with snacks and drinks. Choose films that you love or ones you’ve never seen before. Make your living room cosy with pillows and blankets. Don’t forget to turn off the lights for a better movie experience.\\n\\nOrganizing your space is also a good idea during a staycation. Clean out your closet, sort your books or rearrange your room. This might not sound like fun, but it feels great after. You will create a peaceful space where you can enjoy spending time.\\n\\nLastly, you can start a small garden or plant some flowers on your balcony. Gardening is a peaceful hobby that can make you happy. Watching your plants grow every day can bring a lot of joy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, you don’t need to go far to have a wonderful holiday. Staycations offer many possibilities to relax and enjoy your time. Whether you try something new or enjoy simple pleasures, the most important thing is to have fun.', 'Global warming is affecting the entire world. The temperatures are rising, which causes the ice in polar regions to melt. As a result, sea levels are increasing, and low-lying areas are in danger. Scientists have been studying these changes for many years. They are researching how we can protect our planet. Green forests are one of the Earth’s greatest assets because they provide clean air to breathe. Without these trees, our living conditions would worsen. The forest plays a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide.\\n\\nHowever, many forests are being cut down at an alarming rate. This deforestation threatens many animals that use trees as shelter. It also affects humans, as we rely on these forests for clean air and water. To ensure a healthy future, more efforts need to be made to stop deforestation. Governments around the world should take steps to protect these natural resources. Many organizations are working to plant more trees.\\n\\nClimate change also affects the weather patterns. Some areas are experiencing more intense rain, while others face longer droughts. These changes make it difficult for people to grow food and find water. Our seasons are becoming unpredictable, which impacts human life and agriculture. Action should be taken by everyone to reduce carbon emissions. We should also be focusing on finding renewable energy sources.\\n\\nIn summary, global warming is a significant challenge. Many changes have already been observed, and more are expected in the future. By working together, we can take steps to lessen the impact. Individuals and governments should work to ensure a greener, healthier planet. Even small actions, like recycling and using public transport, can contribute to protecting our world.', 'RoboCup is a football competition that has taken place every year since 1997. But the players are not human; they are robots. The competition’s full name is ‘Robot Soccer World Cup,’ and the aim is to create, by the middle of the 21st century, a team of robot footballers that are able to play against and beat the winners of the real World Cup.\\n\\nIn order for robots to play football, robotics companies have had to develop special technologies. A robot can’t just run onto the field and start kicking the ball. So each robot is fitted with a webcam which is connected to a computer inside the robot. The robot is able to see where the other players are, where the goal is and, most importantly, where the ball is. They are programmed to make their own decisions and during the match the robots’ creators are not allowed to tell them what to do. The robots are, however, able to communicate with other members of their team, via a wireless network. They might, for example, communicate a message like this to a team-mate: ‘I’m nearest the ball. I’m going to kick it. You go and defend the goal.’ They know who to pass to and how best to get the ball past an opponent. Australian, German and American teams dominate the competition, though teams from twelve countries competed at the last tournament.\\n\\nThere is a long way to go before robots will be able to compete against humans. They need to become more intelligent and become able to react more quickly and anticipate the game. But the technologies that are being developed for scoring goals have other uses as well. It may be possible to develop robots that can be used in search and rescue, for example, finding people trapped in buildings after earthquakes.\\n\\nThey may not be as fun to watch as real footballers, but at least they don’t demand enormous salaries!', '‘Have you eaten?’ – May 13th\\n\\nSingaporeans are my kind of people – they’re passionate about food and eating!\\n\\nPeople here eat often – they have five or six meals a day. Instead of ‘Hello’ or ‘How are you?’ they ask, ‘Have you eaten?’. And it’s hard to believe just how many different kinds of dishes you can get in this tiny country – Chinese, Indian, Arabic, European and many, many more.\\n\\nThe best meal of the day today was lunch. The main course was muri ghonto or fish head curry – far more delicious than it sounds! It’s a southern Indian dish. You can have it with rice, but we had it the way that the Chinese do, with a soft bread roll.\\n\\nDessert was cendol – coconut milk, ice and green noodles. It’s a typical south-east Asian dish. It wasn’t as sweet as I expected, but the noodles were lovely – a bit like jelly.\\n\\nThere are places to eat here to suit everyone – from food stalls in shopping malls to more upmarket (and more expensive!) restaurants. My plan is to try as many as I can in the short time I’m here.\\n\\n\\nHawker centres – street food, but not on the streets – May 14th\\n\\nSingapore is famous for its street food, but it’s been illegal to sell cooked food in the streets for many years. So, if you’re looking for Singapore’s famous street food, hawker centres are the places to go. These are indoor food markets with stalls that sell freshly cooked food. You choose your hawker centre according to what kind of cuisine you fancy – Thai, Malay, Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern.\\n\\nI went to the Golden Mile Food Centre – it was amazing to see so many different food stalls under one roof. Sup tulang – a Malay-Indian dish of beef bones in a red spicy sauce – looked very tasty. But in the end I wanted something lighter, so I chose ayam buah keluak, a Paranakan (Chinese-Malay) dish. It’s chicken with Indonesian black nuts, served with steamed rice. A good choice – one of the most unusual dishes I’ve ever tasted.\\n\\n\\nLittle India, big appetite – May 15th\\n\\nThis part of Singapore was full of the sights and smells of India. I ate thosai – crispy Indian pancakes made from rice and lentils. They were served with rich and spicy dips and vegetable curry. The meal was light and fresh – delicious!\\n\\nStill full from my Indian lunch, I explored the Arab Quarter. There was plenty of great food on offer, but sadly I wasn’t hungry! I’ll have to come back to Singapore. I haven’t had a chance to explore Chinatown either.\\n\\nBy the evening I was hungry again, so I tried some of the barbecued food at Lau Pa Sat, an old market. I went for Malaysian chicken satay, pieces of chicken on sticks served with spicy peanut sauce. Absolutely delicious!', 'Untouchable – the true story of an unlikely friendship\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUntouchable, a charming French comedy about two friends who have almost nothing in common, has been a huge international success. But, before their story became a cinematic sensation, how exactly did a rich French aristocrat and an Algerian immigrant with a criminal past become good friends?\\n\\n\\nPhilippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou first met in Paris in 1993 when Philippe was looking for a nurse. Philippe was from a very wealthy family. At one time he had been a successful businessman, living a life of great luxury. Then he had a terrible paragliding accident and lost the use of his arms and legs. Life in a wheelchair was lonely and boring. Philippe was struggling to imagine the future, and he needed practical help with his day-to-day life.\\n\\n\\nPhilippe interviewed more than 80 people for the job of nurse, but none of them seemed right. Then he met Abdel, who had quit a life of crime in Algeria and moved to France to look for work. He was lively, intelligent and quick-thinking, with a crazy sense of humour. Philippe got on with Abdel immediately, and he offered him the job.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two men didn’t have much in common. Abdel loved pop music, but Philippe preferred classical music. Philippe loved modern art, but Abdel hated it. Philippe’s family were sure that he had made a bad choice. They believed that Philippe needed someone much more sensible. Meanwhile, Abdel wasn’t planning on staying in the job for long.\\n\\n\\nHowever, their working relationship quickly developed into a close friendship. Abdel gave Philippe the support he needed. More importantly, his energy and sense of humour brought fun and excitement back into Philippe’s life. Abdel helped Philippe make trips to other countries. Back home in Paris their adventures included traveling around the streets of Paris with Abdel on the back of Philippe’s wheelchair or driving Philippe’s Rolls-Royce – often much too fast!\\n\\n\\nIn the end, Abdel worked for Philippe for ten years. Philippe believes it was Abdel’s energy and sense of fun that kept him alive. ‘I suddenly found I was enjoying life again,’ he says. ‘I felt like I didn’t know what was coming next.’ As for Abdel, getting to know Philippe had kept him out of prison and introduced him to a new way of life.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhilippe and Abdel now live in different countries, each with a wife and family. They keep in touch regularly. Over the years they have learnt, among other things, to enjoy each other’s favourite music. All that really matters to their friendship, though, is their shared love of laughter and adventure.', 'The unhealthiest places in the world\\nAccording to a study by Clinic Compare, the unhealthiest country in the world is the Czech Republic. The study, which compared data on alcohol, tobacco consumption and obesity in 179 countries, found that Czech Republic residents are among the world’s heaviest drinkers. Indeed, nine of the ten unhealthiest countries are located in Eastern Europe, where smoking is more common than in the rest of the world and is increasing among teenagers. The only one outside this region was the USA, where 36 per cent of the population are obese. Obesity levels are lower in the Czech Republic but are the highest in Europe.\\n\\nThe study must be taken with a pinch of salt, however. According to the rankings, the healthiest country in the world is Afghanistan due to its low obesity and alcohol consumption. In second and third place are Guinea and Niger. But that doesn’t make them healthy places to live. Indeed, four countries listed among Clinic Compare’s top ten healthiest countries, Guinea, DR Congo, Malawi and Mozambique, were among the least healthy nations in another study, the Global Competitiveness Index.\\n\\nHigh consumption of alcohol, tobacco and food are diseases of affluence; that is, they are common in wealthy countries. However, many countries, especially in Africa, are still struggling with diseases of poverty. For example, the average life expectancy in DR Congo is just 53 years old. Here, many people die from diseases which could be treated in other countries. In Malawi, tuberculosis and HIV are common. These countries lack basic medical facilities and trained doctors. In Mozambique, where 30% of people cannot access health services, lack of nutrients in the diet is a far more common medical problem than overeating.\\n\\nMoreover, Nepal, listed by Clinic Compare as the fourth healthiest country, is the tenth most polluted country and Afghanistan the fourteenth. Air pollution is a killer, with 7 million people dying worldwide each year from diseases associated with it. It is not just vehicle fumes and industries which are the problem. Around 2.4 billion people worldwide are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution while cooking on fires or stoves fuelled by kerosene, wood, dung and coal.\\n\\nAccording to a different study, which measured factors such as the cost of staying healthy, life expectancy, air pollution, obesity, sunlight hours and crime rate, the healthiest country is Spain. This is most likely due to its traditionally healthy diet, clean air, the number of people walking to work (37%), and free healthcare. Interestingly, another study, the Global Health Security Index, ranks the USA as the healthiest nation. This was because its high standards in research, safety and communication allow it to detect and respond to pandemics the most effectively. This contrasts with the Clinic Compare survey, which ranked it the tenth unhealthiest country, primarily because of its high obesity rate.\\n\\nThe countries with the highest levels of obesity, however, are in the Pacific islands. In countries such as Nauru, Tuvalu and Palau, over half the population is obese. This is a relatively new trend, as, before the 1950s, locals consumed a traditional diet that included bananas, coconuts, yams and seafood. Since then, incomes have increased, making imported convenience foods more affordable. This new scenario causes people to make poor food choices despite the availability of healthier, locally-grown options. In many regions of the USA, healthy choices just aren’t available, or they are too expensive. In addition, this country’s driving culture means that many people don’t get enough exercise.', 'ANNA\\n\\nI had my own business, but needed a website. My friend Wendy gave me the email address of a designer called Mark. Unfortunately, Wendy’s handwriting is awful, so I sent the email to the wrong person. Someone called Matt replied. Obviously, there had been a mistake. He said he wasn’t actually a designer – he was a primary school teacher – but he could help me if I wanted!\\n\\nMatt seemed nice. And anyway, I didn’t have anyone else to help me, so I decided to write back to him. In the end, Matt worked on my website for free. He did a great job and my business started to go really well. Meanwhile, we got to know each other via email. And ten months later, we met. We fell in love immediately, and a year later, we got married. If Wendy had had better handwriting, my business wouldn’t have been such a success, and I certainly wouldn’t have met Matt!\\n\\n\\nTwo years ago, Anna Frances had some very good luck when her colleague gave her some wrong information.\\n\\nSo was Anna just lucky? Or did she make her own luck? Why do these lucky accidents seem to happen to some people and not to others? And is there any way to make yourself more lucky? Well, it seems that the secret of happiness is to make the most of the opportunities that life gives us. We need to be open to serendipity – the random events that lead to happy, sometimes life-changing, results.\\n\\nDr Stephann Makri is working on a project about serendipity at University College, London. He thinks that serendipity is more than an accident and that we can all have more ‘luck’ if we learn to pay attention to life’s opportunities. He has noticed that many people’s good-luck stories share the same basic pattern. First, people notice that there is an opportunity. Then, they take action to make the most of it. For example, if you imagine meeting an old friend in the street who will later introduce you to the love of your life, several things have to happen. First, you have to notice the friend. Then you have to stop and talk to them, even though you might be busy. Finally, you need to be ready to follow up on whatever comes out of the conversation. So, it might be luck that leads you to walk past the friend on the street – but the rest is up to you!\\n\\n\\nMore serendipity stories …\\n\\nTOM\\n\\nAfter university, I didn’t have a job. I subscribed to a job website and got lots of emails from them every day. I usually deleted them. One day, I was feeling particularly annoyed by all the emails, so I opened one of them to click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link. But I spotted an interesting job. It was in the USA and I didn’t really have the experience they wanted, but I decided to try. I didn’t get the job, but they emailed me two weeks later to say they had another job I could apply for. I got it, and I ended up working in New York City, where I met my girlfriend Paula. None of it would have happened if I had deleted the email.\\n\\n\\nCARLA\\n\\nMy mum Betty is 71. There’s a café in town that I like and I persuaded my mum to come with me, just to get out of the house. She didn’t want to come at first, but when we got there she really liked the café. While we were there, she started chatting to some bikers. My mum said she had always wanted to ride a motorbike! I was shocked! Kenny, one of the bikers, offered to take us both out with the rest of the group. To my amazement, my mother said ‘yes’! I was really worried, but actually, my mum loved the experience!', 'Curriculum Vitaes: Tips that can Help\\nSix out of ten CV’s which are prepared by Information Technology professionals fail to meet the basic standards and are turned down without even being read fully, according to a recruitment company. As a consequence, thousands of candidates are excluding themselves from attractive job opportunities.\\n\\nAlthough the company handles over 60,000 CV’s per year, it estimates that at least 60% would not be admitted if they were sent directly to potential clients due to basic errors.\\n\\nThe company Marketing Director said, “Sadly it’s often the most highly qualified candidates whose CV’s are so poorly constructed that they are literally dead on arrival. Attractive job opportunities in the IT industry often generate intense competition and there is often little to choose between the candidates”.\\n\\n“Advice on the presentation format of CV’s in relation to the requirements that they are being submitted for should be an Industry standard so as to add real value to the candidates that you are representing and indeed to fulfil your professional obligations to your clients”.\\n\\n“Writing a CV can be extremely difficult and too often a CV turns out to be a generic overview including a lot of information that is irrelevant. People should remember that an employer typically spends between 15 and 30 seconds scanning each CV and you have that one chance to make an impression”.\\n\\n“A good CV is more than just documentation of your career path; it is a marketing tool designed to present your professional career experience according to the new job specification. It should also include details of past professional successes that effectively demonstrate your ability to undertake the job responsibilities outlined”.', 'Chicago\\nKeith recently came back from a trip to Chicago, Illinois. This midwestern metropolis is found along the shore of Lake Michigan. During his visit, Keith spent a lot of time exploring the city to visit important landmarks and monuments.\\n\\nKeith loves baseball, and he made sure to take a visit to Wrigley Field. Not only did he take a tour of this spectacular stadium, but he also got to watch a Chicago Cubs game. In the stadium, Keith and the other fans cheered for the Cubs. Keith was happy that the Cubs won with a score of 5-4.\\n\\nChicago has many historic places to visit. Keith found the Chicago Water Tower impressive as it is one of the few remaining landmarks to have survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Keith also took a walk through Jackson Park, a great outdoor space that hosted the World’s Fair of 1892. The park is great for a leisurely stroll, and it still features some of the original architecture and replicas of monuments that were featured in the World’s Fair.\\n\\nDuring the last part of his visit, Keith managed to climb the stairs inside of the Willis Tower, a 110-story skyscraper. Despite the challenge of climbing the many flights of stairs, Keith felt that reaching the top was worth the effort. From the rooftop, Keith received a gorgeous view of the city’s skyline with Lake Michigan in the background.', 'Christmas\\nA Christian holiday signifying the birth of Jesus, Christmas is widely celebrated and enjoyed across the United States and the world. The holiday always falls on 25 December (regardless of the day of the week), and is typically accompanied by decorations, presents, and special meals.\\n\\nSpecifically, the legend behind Christmas (and the one that most children are told) is that Santa Claus, a bearded, hefty, jolly, and red-jacket-wearing old man who lives in the North Pole, spends the year crafting presents with his elves, or small, festive, excited Santa-assistants. All the children who behave throughout the year are admitted to the Good List, and will presumably receive their desired gifts on Christmas, while those who don\\'t behave are placed on the Naughty List, and will presumably (although the matter is determined by parents) receive a lump of coal.\\n\\nSanta Claus is said to fly around the Christmas sky in a sled powered by his magical reindeer, or cold-resistant, mythically powered, individually named animals, delivering presents to each child\\'s house in the process. Santa is also expected to slide through chimneys to deliver these presents (homes not equipped with chimneys might \"leave the front door cracked open\"), and children sometimes arrange cookies or other treats on a plate for him to enjoy.\\n\\nGifts are placed underneath a Christmas tree, or a pine tree that\\'s decorated with ornaments and/or lights and is symbolic of the holiday. Additionally, smaller gifts may be placed inside a stocking, or a sock-shaped, holiday-specific piece of fabric that\\'s generally hung on the mantle of a fireplace (homes without fireplaces might use the wall). A Christmas tree\\'s ornaments, or hanging, typically spherical decorations, in addition to the mentioned lights, may be accompanied by a star, or a representation of the Star of Jerusalem that the Three Apostles followed while bringing Baby Jesus gifts and honoring him, in the Bible.', 'Food\\nWhile eating at a restaurant is an enjoyable and convenient occasional treat, most individuals and families prepare their meals at home. To make breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, these persons must have the required foods and ingredients on hand and ready to go; foods and ingredients are typically purchased from a grocery store, or an establishment that distributes foods, drinks, household products, and other items that\\'re used by the typical consumer.\\n\\nProduce, or the term used to describe fresh fruits and vegetables, is commonly purchased by grocery store shoppers. In terms of fruit, most grocery stores offer bananas, apples, oranges, blackberries, raspberries, grapes, pineapples, cantaloupes, watermelons, and more; other grocery stores with larger produce selections might offer the listed fruits in addition to less common fruits, including mangoes, honeydews, starfruits, coconuts, and more.\\n\\nDepending on the grocery store, customers can purchase fruits in a few different ways. Some stores will charge a set amount per pound of fruit, and will weigh customers\\' fruit purchases and bill them accordingly; other stores will charge customers for each piece of fruit they buy, or for bundles of fruit (a bag of bananas, a bag of apples, etc.); other stores yet will simply charge by the container.\\n\\nVegetables, including lettuce, corn, tomatoes, onions, celery, cucumbers, mushrooms, and more are also sold at many grocery stores, and are purchased similarly to the way that fruits are. Grocery stores typically stock more vegetables than fruit at any given time, as vegetables remain fresh longer than fruits do, generally speaking.\\n\\nIt\\'d take quite a while to list everything else that today\\'s massive grocery stores sell, but most customers take the opportunity to shop for staples, or foods that play a prominent role in the average diet, at the establishments. Staples include pasta, rice, flour, sugar, milk, meat, and eggs, and bread. All the listed staples are available in prepackaged containers, but can be purchased \"fresh\" in some grocery stores, wherein employees will measure and weigh fresh products and then provide them to customers.', 'Going to work in the morning\\nMy job is a long distance from my home, almost 50 miles away. I have to wake up early every morning, as I’m always in a rush. There’s never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. At exactly 6:00 AM, I get into my car and start the long drive.\\n\\nI usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. During the morning rush hour, though, it’s not very enjoyable. The heavy traffic is a little bit annoying. So I always listen to my favorite classical music CD’s in the car – Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot.\\n\\nThe drive to work takes about one hour. Going back home in the evening after work takes even longer, maybe around 70 minutes. Lately I’ve been thinking about trying to take the train to work instead of driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same time.']\n"
